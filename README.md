Melbourn Eastern Wastewater Treatment Plant 

Project Aim: Predicting the Total Grid Power Consumption

With having the effluent data of the plant and the energy consumption we begin the project.
Later on, we obtained the daily climate reports through web-scraping from Melbourn airport weather station.

As TN and BOD samplings occurs once a week, we had missing data in these columns.

After predicting the missing values with almost (40%) accuracy, we performed a comprehensive Feature selection and machine learning study to find the best way to predict the power consumption
